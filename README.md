# Atwood's Machine Simulation App
Overview
The Atwood's Machine Simulation App is an interactive tool that visualizes the mechanics of the Atwood's machine, allowing users to explore the effects of different mass values on the system's motion. This app serves as an educational resource for students and educators to understand fundamental physics concepts.

Features
Interactive Mass Input: Users can input different mass values for two connected weights.
Dynamic Animation: Visual representation of the masses and ropes in motion, demonstrating the principles of acceleration and tension.
Clear Visualization: Easy-to-understand graphics that illustrate the behavior of the Atwood's machine
