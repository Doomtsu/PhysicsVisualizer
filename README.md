# General Physics Visualizer
Physics Visualizer is an interactive application designed to help users explore and understand various concepts in physics through dynamic visualizations. This tool aims to provide an engaging learning experience by allowing users to manipulate parameters and observe the effects in real-time. The app currently features an Atwood's machine simulation, with plans to expand to include additional physics phenomena. 

Features
-  Interactive Simulations: Users can input different parameters to see how they affect the system's behavior.
-  Dynamic Animations: Visual representations of various physics concepts, making learning intuitive and engaging.
-  Expandable Framework: Designed to easily incorporate additional visualizations and physics concepts in the future.
